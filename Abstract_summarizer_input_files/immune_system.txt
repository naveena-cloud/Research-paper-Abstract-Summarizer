Human immune system: Exploring diversity across individuals
and populations

ABSTRACT
The immune response is a sophisticated system involving the intricate interplay of cellular and molecular elements, each with unique functional roles. It exhibits a remarkable ability to adapt and shape itself in response to distinct stimuli, influenced by both hereditary and environmental factors. Genetic variation, especially among various ethnic and racial groups, plays a substantial role in determining disease prevalence, vulnerability to illnesses, autoimmune conditions, and cancer susceptibility in specific areas and demographic groups. Environmental influences, such as geographic location and economic status, further regulate the spectrum of immune responses. These aspects collectively affect vulnerability to infectious diseases and the onset of autoimmune disorders. Despite the complexity of these associations, a significant knowledge gap persists regarding the specificity of immune parameters across racial groups and reference immune ranges within populations. This underscores the necessity for a more nuanced understanding of immune variability to enable individualized strategies in diagnosis and treatment. This review methodically compiles these insights, aiming to highlight the potential for targeted solutions to bridge health inequalities and propel translational research. Such an approach holds promise for meaningful progress in pinpointing distinct immunological conditions and advancing tailored interventions driven by both genetic and environmental determinants.

1. Introduction
The human immune system represents an intricate network of cells, tissues, and organs that collaborate to protect the body from harmful pathogens [1]. This elaborate defense mechanism shows considerable variability among individuals, which plays a vital role in influencing disease vulnerability, therapeutic efficacy, and overall health outcomes [2].
Recent investigations have underscored the crucial significance of understanding the diversity within the immune system. This variation arises from a wide range of factors, including genetic makeup, epigenetic alterations, environmental interactions, and lifestyle choices [3]. Genetic differences, particularly across various population groups, profoundly influence the regional prevalence of diseases and the susceptibility of specific communities to certain medical conditions [4]. For example, racial classification can serve as a predictive marker for certain illnesses when a disproportionately higher incidence is observed among specific racial demographics [5].
Leveraging modern innovations such as genomics, computational biology, and other advanced methodologies, numerous studies have revealed immunological distinctions across races. These include disparities in immune responsiveness, infection susceptibility, autoimmune disease trends, and cancer characteristics [6,7,8,9]. Nevertheless, substantial gaps remain in our comprehension of how these racial variations affect disease diagnostics, treatment planning, and clinical outcomes—especially concerning diagnostic benchmarks and normal physiological ranges.
By delving into the intricacies of immune variation, scientists can pave the way for more precise and individualized approaches to disease prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. This review aims to examine the principal contributors to immune system diversity, including genetic polymorphisms, epigenetic shifts, and environmental exposures. Furthermore, we emphasize the limited availability of data concerning immune reference ranges across diverse racial and geographical groups. Bridging these research gaps will promote further scientific exploration and foster a more nuanced, personalized approach to immunological health across different populations.

### **The Role of Immune Response Variability in Cancer Incidence Across Populations**

The Global Database on Cancer Incidence provides critical insights into disparities in cancer rates worldwide, emphasizing the impact of genetic makeup, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences on cancer susceptibility. For example, lung cancer incidence among men in affluent countries like the United States is approximately 57.3 per 100,000, with notably higher rates observed among African American men compared to other ethnic groups \[115]. Similarly, breast cancer rates in industrialized regions such as the United States and Western Europe range between 90–120 per 100,000 women, whereas several African and Asian nations report lower figures, typically between 20–40 per 100,000 \[116]. Colorectal cancer shows comparable trends, with Western nations reporting rates of 40–50 per 100,000, which are significantly greater than those seen in many low-income countries \[117]. Prostate cancer rates are the highest globally among African American men, reaching up to 120 per 100,000, a disparity linked to both genetic predispositions and unequal access to healthcare services \[118]. Additionally, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is far more prevalent in regions like East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, with incidence rates exceeding 30–40 per 100,000. This is primarily due to risk factors such as chronic hepatitis B infections and exposure to aflatoxins \[119]. These population-specific differences in cancer rates highlight the urgent need for tailored prevention and intervention strategies grounded in localized health data.

### **4.2.1 Lung Cancer**

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide and demonstrates significant population-level differences influenced by tobacco use, environmental exposure, and genetic predisposition \[115]. In high-income countries such as the United States, lung cancer remains prevalent among men, largely due to historical smoking trends, prolonged exposure to industrial carcinogens, and legacy air pollution \[116].

Interestingly, certain Asian populations exhibit disproportionately high lung cancer rates despite relatively low smoking prevalence. This phenomenon is partially attributed to genetic vulnerabilities—most notably, the higher incidence of **epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)** mutations, which play a central role in tumor development and progression. These population-specific genetic traits highlight the importance of integrating molecular diagnostics into lung cancer screening and treatment strategies across diverse demographic groups.

### **4.2.2 Breast Cancer**

Breast cancer incidence reflects a complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that vary widely across global populations \[116]. In economically developed regions such as the United States and Western Europe, breast cancer rates are markedly higher. This trend is linked to factors such as delayed childbearing, reduced parity, dietary patterns, increased obesity, and the use of hormone replacement therapy—each of which contributes to prolonged lifetime estrogen exposure \[125].

Conversely, lower incidence rates are reported in many Asian and African countries, where protective factors like earlier childbirth, higher breastfeeding rates, and lower alcohol consumption are more prevalent \[126].

Genetic predisposition also significantly influences breast cancer risk. For instance, **BRCA1** and **BRCA2** gene mutations are notably more common among Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, occurring in approximately 2.0–2.5% of the population—about five times higher than in the general population \[127]. These mutations considerably elevate the lifetime risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers.

Breast cancer outcomes and treatment responses vary across populations due to differences in tumor biology, healthcare access, and genetic background. African American and Hispanic women in the United States, for example, are more likely to be diagnosed with **triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)**—a more aggressive subtype that lacks estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors—often at a more advanced stage and with poorer prognosis \[128].

Advancements in targeted therapies, such as **HER2 inhibitors** and hormone-based treatments, have improved survival for patients whose tumors express these receptors. However, individuals with TNBC typically require chemotherapy or are candidates for emerging **immunotherapy** and novel biologics, given the absence of hormone or HER2 expression \[129].

Screening practices also differ globally, shaped by risk profiles and healthcare infrastructure. In high-income settings, routine **mammography** for women over 50 enables earlier detection and improves survival \[130]. In contrast, low-resource countries rely more heavily on **clinical breast exams** or opportunistic screening. While these methods are less sensitive, they still play a critical role in early diagnosis.

For high-risk individuals, particularly those carrying **BRCA mutations**, personalized screening protocols that combine **MRI and mammography** have shown increased effectiveness in early detection \[131]. These advancements underscore the necessity of individualized and population-informed breast cancer management strategies.


### **4.2.3 Colorectal Cancer (CRC)**

Expanding on the trends seen in lung and breast cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) also displays striking regional and demographic variation influenced by a mix of genetic, dietary, and lifestyle elements. In high-income nations, CRC risk is heightened due to the consumption of red and processed meats—foods associated with carcinogenic byproducts—and a deficiency of dietary fiber, which adversely affects gut microbiota and colon transit time \[132]. In comparison, plant-based diets prevalent in many developing regions are linked to lower CRC rates, attributed to higher intake of antioxidants and fiber, which may offer a protective effect \[133].

Around 75% of CRC cases are sporadic, arising without a known hereditary component, while roughly 25% are familial, suggesting a role for inherited genetic mutations or shared environmental factors \[134]. Countries like the U.S., Western Europe, and Australia exhibit some of the highest CRC rates, whereas regions in Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Asia typically show lower incidence. However, as more developing nations adopt Westernized lifestyles and diets, CRC rates are beginning to climb \[135].

At the molecular level, CRC develops through two primary genomic instability pathways: chromosomal instability (CIN) and microsatellite instability (MIN), both of which contribute to alterations in key regulatory genes like APC, p53, and SMAD4, facilitating tumor progression \[136]. Familial cancer syndromes, such as Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) involving APC gene mutations, further illustrate the genetic basis behind CRC susceptibility \[137].

Health outcomes and access to treatment for CRC also vary substantially between populations. In wealthier regions, widespread use of screening tools like colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) enables earlier detection, significantly boosting survival rates \[138]. Conversely, in areas with limited access to healthcare services, CRC is often diagnosed in later stages, when prognosis is poorer and treatment options are more restricted \[117]. For individuals with heightened risk—due to either family history or confirmed genetic mutations—customized screening schedules that begin earlier and occur more frequently are recommended to manage and reduce risk effectively \[139].

Here's a revised version of the **"Population-level variations in infectious disease response"** section, with improved flow, alternative vocabulary, and variation in structure while maintaining clarity and factual accuracy:

Population-Level Variations in Infectious Disease Response: The Impact of Immune System Diversity
Immune system diversity—shaped by an intricate interplay of genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors—plays a critical role in determining the prevalence, susceptibility, and clinical outcomes of infectious diseases across global populations. Significant disparities are observed worldwide: for instance, Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden of malaria, accounting for approximately 95% of global cases and deaths, with children and pregnant women especially at risk [177]. Similarly, tuberculosis (TB) demonstrates regional variation, with incidence rates exceeding 200 per 100,000 in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to fewer than 10 per 100,000 in many high-income countries [178].

Racial and ethnic disparities became particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, African American and Hispanic populations experienced hospitalization and mortality rates nearly two to three times higher than White Americans, largely driven by pre-existing health disparities and systemic socioeconomic disadvantages [179]. Herpesviruses also exhibit marked population-level differences; for example, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) has a seroprevalence of about 50% in African populations versus 20% in Europe, reflecting both genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure [180].

HIV continues to highlight deep demographic and regional divides. In the U.S., African Americans face HIV incidence rates approximately eight times higher than White Americans, while Sub-Saharan Africa remains home to two-thirds of the global HIV population [181]. These disparities underscore the urgent need for population-specific approaches in infectious disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment—grounded in a deeper understanding of immune diversity.

5.2.1 Malaria
Malaria displays significant geographic and population-level variation, driven by differences in host genetics, ecological conditions, and immune system traits. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 95% of malaria cases worldwide, while Southeast Asia and Latin America report considerably lower incidence rates—differences shaped by evolutionary and environmental factors [177].

One of the most well-known examples of genetic adaptation is the sickle cell trait (HbAS), prevalent in African populations, which offers 60–90% protection against severe malaria by altering red blood cell shape and hindering parasite development [182]. In Southeast Asia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency provides some protective effect but complicates treatment due to risks of drug-induced hemolysis, especially with primaquine [183].

Additional genetic polymorphisms also influence malaria susceptibility. The HLA-B*53 allele, common in West Africa, enhances immune defense, while variants in cytokine genes like TNF and IL10 shape immune response intensity and disease progression [184]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified influential variants in genes like CR1 and FcγRIIa, involved in immune signaling and parasite clearance [185].

The RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) malaria vaccine shows varied efficacy across populations, partly due to differences in host immune genetics, such as HLA allele distribution [186]. Pharmacogenomic traits like G6PD deficiency further complicate treatment efficacy and safety, highlighting the necessity for precision medicine approaches [187]. Future efforts should integrate genomic, environmental, and regional data to develop customized diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines tailored to specific population needs.

5.2.2 Tuberculosis (TB)
Tuberculosis (TB) continues to show significant disparities in incidence and clinical outcomes, with rates exceeding 220 per 100,000 in high-burden regions such as South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to fewer than 60 per 100,000 in Europe [178].

Diversity in immune responses plays a pivotal role in TB susceptibility. Genetic factors such as the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele—frequent in certain Asian populations—are linked to increased vulnerability by impairing immune recognition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [188]. Environmental stressors, including overcrowding, malnutrition, and poor living conditions, further elevate TB risk in low-income settings [189].

Children with compromised immunity and inadequate nutrition are particularly at risk, emphasizing the need for population-specific interventions. GWAS have identified gene polymorphisms in TLR2 and NRAMP1, which regulate innate immune responses and pathogen elimination, contributing to differences in TB susceptibility [190].

These genetic and environmental variables also affect vaccine efficacy and drug metabolism. For instance, immune system differences contribute to variable responses to the BCG vaccine [191]. Genetic variants in metabolizing enzymes such as NAT2 and CYP2E1 influence isoniazid metabolism, affecting both drug toxicity and treatment success rates [192].

To enhance TB prevention and control, strategies must consider genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic dimensions to develop more effective, population-responsive vaccines, diagnostics, and therapies.

5.2.3 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed sharp disparities in infection rates and clinical outcomes across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines. In the United States, African American, Hispanic, and Indigenous populations experienced disproportionately high infection, hospitalization, and death rates—driven by systemic inequities such as limited healthcare access, higher rates of comorbidities, and occupational exposure risks.

Emerging evidence suggests genetic differences also contribute to variation in disease outcomes. For instance, specific HLA alleles and polymorphisms in the ACE2 receptor may modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and influence immune responses. These biological factors, combined with social determinants of health, help explain the unequal impact across populations.

Disparities were also evident in vaccine access, uptake, and immune response, particularly in underrepresented communities. Such variation highlights the urgent need for more inclusive vaccine trials and equitable public health policies.

To prepare for future pandemics, it is critical to integrate immunogenetic insights into global health planning. This will ensure that prevention, diagnostic, and treatment strategies are tailored not only to pathogens but also to the diverse populations they affect—supporting more equitable and effective public health outcomes.
