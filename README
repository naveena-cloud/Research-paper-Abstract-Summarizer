# A Transformer-Driven GenAI Platform for Research Abstract Summarization

## Overview
This project presents a transformer-driven Generative AI platform that automatically extracts and summarizes research paper abstracts. Using a state-of-the-art transformer model and an interactive interface, the system enables efficient understanding of academic documents across multiple formats.

## Objectives
- Automatically extract abstract sections from research documents  
- Generate concise, human-like summaries using Generative AI  
- Support multiple file formats including PDF, TXT, and CSV  
- Enable batch processing of multiple research files  
- Provide downloadable summarized outputs  

## Technologies Used
- Python (Google Colab)  
- Transformers (facebook/bart-large-cnn)  
- Gradio (User Interface & Login System)  
- PyMuPDF (PDF Text Extraction)  
- Regular Expressions (Abstract Detection)  
- Matplotlib (Visualization)  
- Zipfile & OS (File Handling)  

## Dataset
This project does not rely on a fixed dataset. Research documents can be uploaded dynamically by users.

### Sample Files used in this project
- `CauseOf_Cancer.pdf`  
- `immune_system.txt`  
- `Neurological_disorders.pdf`  
- `Genetic_engg.pdf`  

## System Workflow
1. User logs in through the Gradio interface  
2. Research documents are uploaded (PDF/TXT/CSV)  
3. Abstract sections are extracted using pattern matching  
4. Summaries are generated using a transformer-based GenAI model  
5. Results are saved and bundled into a downloadable ZIP file  

## Supported File Formats
- PDF  
- TXT  
- CSV  

## Key Features
- Transformer-based Generative AI summarization  
- Intelligent abstract extraction  
- Multi-file upload and batch processing  
- Downloadable summary files  
- Clean and interactive user interface  

## Applications
- Academic research and literature reviews  
- Student project analysis  
- Research assistance tools  
- Large-scale document summarization  

## Conclusion
This platform demonstrates the effective use of transformer-driven Generative AI for automating research abstract extraction and summarization. It improves research productivity by reducing manual effort and enabling faster comprehension of scholarly documents.
